## 🚀 Quick Start
### Run with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed, then run:

```bash
docker run -d --name dory \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DS_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n')" \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" \
  -e DORY_AI_PROVIDER=openai \
  -e DORY_AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini \
  -e DORY_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
  -e DORY_AI_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 \
  dorylab/dory:latest

```
### 🧠 Supported AI Providers

Dory is built with a pluggable AI provider architecture.
You can freely switch between different model vendors by changing environment variables — no code changes required.

Currently supported providers:

| Provider | Env `DORY_AI_PROVIDER` | Description |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------|
| OpenAI | `openai` | Default provider. Uses official OpenAI API. |
| OpenAI-Compatible | `openai-compatible` | Any service exposing an OpenAI-compatible API. |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | Claude models via Anthropic official API. |
| Google | `google` | Gemini models via Google Generative AI API. |
| Qwen (Alibaba) | `qwen` | Qwen models via DashScope OpenAI-compatible endpoint. |
| xAI | `xai` | Grok models via xAI API. |

### Generate Release Notes

Use dedicated `RELEASE_NOTES_AI_*` environment variables to generate English release notes from git commits without sharing product runtime credentials:

```bash
yarn release-notes
```

Useful options:

```bash
yarn release-notes --from v0.3.6 --to HEAD
yarn release-notes --output ./release-notes/v0.3.7.md
yarn release-notes --model gpt-4o-mini
```

The GitHub release workflow also writes the generated markdown to `release-notes/<tag>.md` and commits it to the repository with the release version update.
